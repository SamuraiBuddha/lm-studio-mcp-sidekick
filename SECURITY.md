# Security Policy

## üõ°Ô∏è LM Studio MCP Sidekick Security

### Overview
This document outlines the security policies, incident response procedures, and vulnerability reporting guidelines for the LM Studio MCP Sidekick project.

## üö® Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### Responsible Disclosure
We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow responsible disclosure practices:

1. **DO NOT** create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities
2. **DO** email security reports to: jordan@ehrigbim.com
3. **DO** provide detailed information about the vulnerability
4. **DO** allow reasonable time for response before public disclosure

### What to Include
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested mitigation (if any)
- Your contact information

### Response Timeline
- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours
- **Triage & Assessment**: Within 72 hours  
- **Fix Development**: Within 7 days (critical), 30 days (non-critical)
- **Patch Deployment**: Within 24 hours of fix completion

## üîê Security Architecture

### Threat Model
Primary threats addressed:
- **Model Hijacking**: Unauthorized access to LM Studio models
- **Data Exfiltration**: Sensitive information leakage through conversations
- **Service Disruption**: DoS attacks against the MCP service
- **Privilege Escalation**: Unauthorized access to system resources
- **Supply Chain**: Malicious dependencies or model files

### Security Controls

#### Authentication & Authorization
- API key validation for LM Studio access
- Role-based access control for MCP operations
- Request signing for webhook validation
- Rate limiting and throttling

#### Data Protection
- TLS encryption for all network communications
- Secure storage of conversation history
- Automatic secret redaction in logs
- Memory cleanup for sensitive data

#### Infrastructure Security
- Container isolation for model execution
- Network segmentation and firewalls  
- Regular security updates and patching
- Monitoring and alerting for anomalies

## üìã Security Checklist

### Development
- [ ] Code review by security-aware personnel
- [ ] Dependency vulnerability scanning
- [ ] Static code analysis (SAST)
- [ ] Secret detection in commits
- [ ] Security unit tests

### Deployment
- [ ] Container image vulnerability scanning
- [ ] Infrastructure as Code (IaC) security scanning
- [ ] TLS certificate validation
- [ ] Environment variable security audit
- [ ] Network security configuration review

### Operations
- [ ] Log monitoring for security events
- [ ] Regular security assessments
- [ ] Incident response plan testing
- [ ] Security training for team members
- [ ] Vendor security assessments

## üîç Security Monitoring

### Automated Detection
- Failed authentication attempts
- Unusual API usage patterns
- Model access anomalies
- Resource consumption spikes
- Suspicious network activity

### Alert Thresholds
- **High**: 10+ failed auth attempts per minute
- **Medium**: Unusual model download requests
- **Low**: Configuration changes outside business hours

### Log Retention
- Security logs: 90 days minimum
- Access logs: 30 days minimum
- Error logs: 30 days minimum
- Audit logs: 1 year minimum

## üö® Incident Response

### Severity Classifications

#### Critical (P0)
- Active exploitation in progress
- Data breach confirmed
- Service completely unavailable
- Response Time: < 1 hour

#### High (P1)  
- Potential security vulnerability
- Partial service degradation
- Suspicious activity detected
- Response Time: < 4 hours

#### Medium (P2)
- Security policy violations
- Performance anomalies
- Configuration issues
- Response Time: < 24 hours

#### Low (P3)
- General security concerns
- Documentation issues
- Enhancement requests
- Response Time: < 72 hours

### Response Procedures

#### Immediate Actions (0-5 minutes)
1. **Assess** - Determine severity and scope
2. **Contain** - Isolate affected systems
3. **Communicate** - Notify incident response team
4. **Document** - Begin incident timeline

#### Short-term Actions (5-60 minutes)
1. **Investigate** - Gather forensic evidence
2. **Mitigate** - Implement temporary fixes
3. **Escalate** - Engage external resources if needed
4. **Update** - Provide status updates to stakeholders

#### Long-term Actions (1-24 hours)
1. **Remediate** - Deploy permanent fixes
2. **Verify** - Confirm issue resolution
3. **Report** - Complete incident documentation
4. **Review** - Conduct post-incident analysis
